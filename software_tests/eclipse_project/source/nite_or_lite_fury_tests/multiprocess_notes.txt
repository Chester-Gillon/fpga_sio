1. Container and group FDs passed to secondary process, but not device FD
=========================================================================

For an initial test of multiprocess VFIO functionality had:
a. A primary process spawn a secondary process.
b. The secondary process was spawned after the primary had called open_vfio_devices_matching_filter()
c. The primary process attempted to call open_vfio_devices_matching_filter() in the same way as the primary.
   As expected based upon previous tests, the secondary process failed with EBUSY attempting to open the group FD
   since had already been opened by the primary process.
d. Added some debug to display the file descriptors in the primary and secondary processes.
e. Realised that open_vfio_device() is *not* using the O_CLOEXEC flag when opens the container and group FDs,
   so they remain open in the secondary.
f. The primary uses the VFIO_GROUP_GET_DEVICE_FD ioctl() to open the device FD, and that isn't open in the secondary.

2. Secondary process uses container and group FDs from primary, and opens device FD
===================================================================================

open_vfio_device() was modified to automatically detect it was running in a secondary process, by container and group FDs
were already open, and just have to open the device FD. 

The test_general_primary process is able to spawn test_general_secondary which can successfully access the
device memmapped BARs via vfio:
