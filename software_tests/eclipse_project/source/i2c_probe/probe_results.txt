The result of running the probe on TEF1001-02-B2IX4-A for which have yet to fit the FMC module or DD3 module was:
[mr_halfword@skylake-alma release]$ i2c_probe/i2c_probe 
Opening device 0000:15:00.0 (10ee:7024) with IOMMU group 25
Using BAR 0 in device 0000:15:00.0 of size 0x2000
Slave 0x40 replied with data 0xff
Slave 0x4f replied with data 0xff
Slave 0x5a replied with data 0xff
Slave 0x5b replied with data 0xff
Slave 0x70 replied with data 0x00
Slave 0x74 replied with data 0xaf

From the documenation under https://shop.trenz-electronic.de/en/TEF1001-02-B2IX4-A-PCIe-FMC-Carrier-with-Xilinx-Kintex-7-160T-4-Lane-PCIe-GEN2-DDR3-SODIMM-ECC?path=Trenz_Electronic/PCIe_Cards/TEF1001/REV02/Documents
then the I2C addresses are:
a. 0x40 is the DCDC U3 LTM4676, which provides 4V and 1.5V.
b. 0x4f is the DCDC U4 LTM4676, which provides 1V.
c. 0x5a and 0x5b look to be in the range for the DDR3 SPD, but for which the DDR3 SODIMM isn't yet populated.
   Not sure if the CPLD which provides the I2C MUX to the FPGA is providing the ACK for these addresses.
d. 0x70 is the Si5338A programmable quad PLL clock generator on-board.
e. 0x74 is the FAN1 control in the CPLD.
