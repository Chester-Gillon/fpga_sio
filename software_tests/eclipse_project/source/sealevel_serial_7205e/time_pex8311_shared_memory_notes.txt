1. time_pex8311_shared_memory_libpciaccess in an i5-2310 system
===============================================================

Using an i5-2310 system.

Used AlmaLinux 8.7 with a 4.18.0-425.13.1.el8_7.x86_64 Kernel, with no special command line options for the test.

Granted user permission to the PCI resources for the devices with the PLX vendor ID:
[mr_halfword@haswell-alma ~]$ cd ~/fpga_sio/software_tests/eclipse_project/
[mr_halfword@haswell-alma eclipse_project]$ ./set_pci_resource_user_permission.sh 10b5

   Max = 5.866459 (Mbytes/sec)

The results show:
a. The CPU writing to the shared memory is faster than reading from the shared memory.
b. Writes use write-combining are faster than writes using uncached-minus.
c. For the release platform the write speed using uncached-minus is about half the write speed for the debug and coverage platforms.
   Using Eclipse to view the diassembly shows:
   - For debug and coverage the compiler calls to memcpy() in the glibc runtime. Haven't single step to see how
     the memcpy() is implemented in terms of instructions.
   - For release the compiler has inlined memcpy() to use a "rep movsq" instruction which moves 64-bits as a time.
d. The PEX8311 has a PCIe 1.0 x1 interface which has a maximum bandwidth of 250 Mbytes/sec, but apparent measured results with
   8192 byte transfers has a reported mean of ~259 Mbytes/sec which slightly exceeds PCIe bandwidth.
   Not sure if there are some posted writes which haven't made it to the shared memory


2. time_pex8311_shared_memory_libpciaccess in an i5-2310 system, with additional test to flush posted writes
============================================================================================================

Used the same system as above, but added an additional test to flush the post writes inside the timing to measure
the write transfer rate.

Ran the tests for the debug, coverage and release platforms:
