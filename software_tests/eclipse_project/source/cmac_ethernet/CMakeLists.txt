# Build the programs for testing the CMAC 100G Ethernet block in Ultrascale+ devices
#
# cmac_axi4_lite_registers.h was generated by Vivado 2025.1 for the U200_100G_ether_simplex_tx design.
# Even though had configured the IP for Simplex TX the generated include file contains the RX specific definitions.
#
# This generated file has "// Disc" placeholder comments, instead of description of the fields.
# Found /opt/Xilinx/2025.1/Vivado/data/ip/xilinx/xxv_ethernet_v5_0/component.xml in the Vivado installation which appears
# to be used in the generation of the include files. Where the XML does contain descriptive text.
