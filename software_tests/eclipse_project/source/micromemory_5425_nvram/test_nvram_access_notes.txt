1. Tests using NOIOMMU mode on an i5-2310 system
================================================

Using an i5-2310 system with AlmaLinux 8.7 which doesn't support the IOMMU, so using VFIO with NOIOMMU mode and
cmem_gdb_access to allocate physical memory with memmap=2050M$4G,1M$6G used on the command line.

Transfer rates when using on PIO:
