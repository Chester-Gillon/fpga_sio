The files in constraints are based upon the contents of https://www.amd.com/bin/public/amdOpenDownload?filename=alveo-u250-xdc_20210909.zip
which was linked from https://www.amd.com/en/support/downloads/alveo-downloads.html/accelerators/alveo/u200.html

While the filename of the download contains U250, the contstaints/readme.txt supplied by AMD clarifies the constraints are valid
for both a Alveo U200 and U250 which use pin compatible FPGAs.
